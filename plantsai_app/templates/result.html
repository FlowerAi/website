                                The pothos plant is considered by many to be a great way to get started caring for
                                houseplants. Since pothos care is easy and undemanding, this lovely plant is an easy way
                                to add some green to your home.
                            </p>

                            <p class="card-text">
                                More than a few plant owners confuse low care with no care, so take note that pothos has
                                a few absolute rules. For one, it requires water and grows best during spring and summer
                                when the soil is kept consistently moist. Take the drainage requirement to heart though,
                                since a pothos sitting in soggy soil is not a happy plant.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                Pothos plants make a great addition to your bathroom or office because they can tolerate
                                low light. While pothos likes a wide variety of light conditions, they do not do well in
                                direct sunlight.
                            </p>

                                Some plants are picky about soil, but pothos is not one of them. Pothos plants grow
                                perfectly well in ordinary soil as long as it drains well. That means that loamy or
                                sandy soil will work, while clay will not. If the soil is constantly saturated, pothos will
                                die.
